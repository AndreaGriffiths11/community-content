# Season of AI
### May 24 to Aug 31, 2024
This folder contains prepared "content-in-a-box" that anyone can use to do a technical talk on Microsoft AI concepts at a user group, meetup, or community event. At the end of the "season", the content in this repo will be archived, and a new season content will be published.

Each topic includes slides and presentation notes. Some will include pre-recorded demos and videos to help you prepare and/or present. Demo code will be available in separate repos linked from each presentation.

## QR Code/Attendee Survey
Whether you use the content provided here directly or adapt to make it your own, please include the provided "Season of AI" QR code slide at the end of your talk. The code links to an attendee survey that helps us better understand how this content is being used so we can keep making more of it in the future!
